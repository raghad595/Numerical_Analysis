# Numerical_Analysis
Enables users to solve problems using root finding methods (Bisection, False-position, Fixed-point, Newton, and Secant), solve an equation system using Gauss-elimination, Gauss-Jordan elimination, LU decomposition, and Cramer rule, and find the maximum or minimum point of a system using the golden-section method. Enables solving an equation system with partial pivoting.
